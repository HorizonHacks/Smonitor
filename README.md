# Smonitor
Initial design for Equitable Elevation IV Hackathon

This website is intended to promote organization and to monitor student mental health. A to-do list along with widgets allows students to keep track of their tasks and find interesting online applications. Also, a quick daily survey lets students (and administrators) keep track of the student's average engagement and mood. Completing tasks or doing the survey result in gems, which could be used for some sort of reward.
